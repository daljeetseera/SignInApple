# SignIn with apple using SwiftUI

A sample code for validating Apple SignIn through SwiftUI

Apple's [example project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/adding_the_sign_in_with_apple_flow_to_your_app) for Sign in with Apple is build with UIKit. In this project, I wrapped the button and the behaviour that goes with it in a SwiftUI component.
